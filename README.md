## Binary Classification Project

This repository contains code and a report for a binary classification project that demonstrates the performance of linear regression and logistic regression models for binary classification tasks. The project involves two datasets, Dataset A and Dataset B, each with a unique distribution of positive and negative samples.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the effectiveness of linear regression and logistic regression models in binary classification tasks. The datasets are generated using bivariate normal distributions, and we train classifiers on both datasets to predict binary labels {0, 1} based on the two-dimensional input vector.

### Code

The "code" directory contains the Python implementation of the linear regression and logistic regression classifiers. The "main.py" file runs the classifiers on both Dataset A and Dataset B, providing training accuracy for each case. The "utils.py" file includes utility functions for data plotting and generation.

#### Report

/docs includes the project report in PDF format. The report provides a detailed analysis of the project, including the methodology, implementation details, results, and visualizations of the decision boundaries.

#### Running the Code

To run the code and reproduce the results, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
